# template-evm

A personal, production-ready template for building EVM-compatible decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols. Designed to be cloned, configured, and deployed quickly for hackathons, competitions, or personal projects.

Supports **Arbitrum**, **Base**, and **Monad** out of the box, with easy extensibility to any EVM-compatible chain.

## What Is This?

`template-evm` is a full-stack monorepo template built to accelerate the development of Ethereum-compatible dApps. It comes pre-configured with everything you need:

- A **Hardhat** environment for writing, compiling, testing, and deploying Solidity smart contracts.
- A **Next.js** frontend with wallet connection powered by Reown AppKit and Wagmi.
- Multi-chain support with a centralized network configuration.
- Automated deploy and verification scripts.
- Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, solhint) already configured.

The goal is simple: clone this repo, replace the example contract and frontend with your own, fill in your environment variables, and you are ready to ship.

## Prerequisites

Before using this template, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

| Requirement | Minimum Version | Check |
|---|---|---|
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) | v22 or higher | `node --version` |
| [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) | v10 or higher | `npm --version` |
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/) | Any recent version | `git --version` |

You will also need:

- A crypto wallet (e.g., [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)) to interact with the dApp.
- A **Reown Project ID** (free) from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com) for wallet connection.
- RPC URLs for the networks you want to deploy to (e.g., from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://infura.io/)).
- Explorer API keys for contract verification (e.g., [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/), [Basescan](https://basescan.org/)).

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd template-evm
```

### 2. Install backend dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section below.

---

## Backend Guide

The backend is a Hardhat project located in the `backend/` folder.

### Compile contracts

```bash
cd backend
npm run compile
```

This compiles all `.sol` files in `contracts/` and auto-generates TypeScript typings in `typechain-types/`.

### Run tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### Check code coverage

```bash
npm run coverage
```

### Start a local blockchain node

```bash
npm run node
```

This starts a local Hardhat node at `http://127.0.0.1:8545` with pre-funded test accounts. Keep this terminal open while developing locally.

### Clean build artifacts

```bash
npm run clean
```

---

## Frontend Guide

The frontend is a Next.js project located in the `frontend/` folder.

### Start development server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Start production server locally

```bash
npm run start
```

### Add a shadcn/ui component

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

Replace `button` with any component from the [shadcn/ui catalog](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components).

---

## Deploying a Smart Contract

### To a local node

Open two terminals:

**Terminal 1 — start the node:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run node
```

**Terminal 2 — deploy:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run deploy:local
```

### To a testnet or mainnet

Make sure your `backend/.env` has the correct `PRIVATE_KEY` and RPC URL for your target network, then run:

```bash
npm run deploy:arbitrumSepolia
```

Replace `arbitrumSepolia` with your target network. The deploy script will automatically wait for enough confirmations before proceeding.

### Automated deploy + verify in one command

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-and-verify.ts --network arbitrumSepolia
```

This script deploys the contract, waits 30 seconds for the explorer to index it, and then verifies it automatically.

---

## Verifying a Smart Contract

Contract verification makes your source code publicly readable on block explorers (Arbiscan, Basescan, etc.).

### Verify after deploy

```bash
npm run verify:arbitrumSepolia
```

You can also verify manually with a specific address:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network arbitrumSepolia <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

If your constructor takes arguments:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network arbitrumSepolia <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <ARG1> <ARG2>
```

> Make sure your explorer API key is set in `backend/.env` before verifying.

---

## Running Tests

```bash
cd backend
npm run test
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
npx hardhat test test/Counter.test.ts
```

To run with gas reporting enabled:

```bash
REPORT_GAS=true npm run test
```

To run with coverage:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

Coverage results will appear in `backend/coverage/index.html`. Open it in a browser for a detailed line-by-line report.

---

## Deploying the Frontend to Vercel

1. Push your repository to GitHub.
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and click **Add New Project**.
3. Import your GitHub repository.
4. Set the **Root Directory** to `frontend`.
5. Add your environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID`.
6. Click **Deploy**.

Vercel will automatically redeploy every time you push to your main branch.

---

## Using This Template for a New Project

1. Clone the repo and set up environment variables as described above.
2. Replace `backend/contracts/Counter.sol` with your own contract.
3. Update `backend/deploy/01_deploy_counter.ts` with your contract name and constructor arguments.
4. Update `backend/test/Counter.test.ts` with tests for your contract.
5. Compile and test: `npm run compile && npm run test`.
6. Update `frontend/app/page.tsx` with your dApp UI.
7. Update `frontend/config/appkit.ts` with your app name, description, and URL.
8. Deploy your contract to the target network.
9. Connect your frontend to the deployed contract using the generated TypeChain types from `backend/typechain-types/`.
10. Deploy the frontend to Vercel.

## Supported Networks

| Network | Type | Chain ID |
|---|---|---|
| Hardhat (local) | Local | 31337 |
| Localhost | Local | 31337 |
| Arbitrum One | Mainnet | 42161 |
| Arbitrum Sepolia | Testnet | 421614 |
| Base | Mainnet | 8453 |
| Base Sepolia | Testnet | 84532 |
| Monad Testnet | Testnet | 10143 |

### Adding a new network

**Backend — `backend/hardhat.config.ts`:**

```typescript
newNetwork: {
  chainId: 12345,
  url: process.env.NEW_NETWORK_RPC_URL || "",
  accounts: PRIVATE_KEY ? [PRIVATE_KEY] : [],
},
```

**Frontend — `frontend/config/chains.ts`:**

```typescript
export const newNetwork = {
  id: 12345,
  name: "New Network",
  nativeCurrency: { name: "ETH", symbol: "ETH", decimals: 18 },
  rpcUrls: { default: { http: ["https://rpc.newnetwork.xyz"] } },
  blockExplorers: { default: { name: "Explorer", url: "https://explorer.newnetwork.xyz" } },
} as const satisfies AppKitNetwork;
```

Then add it to the `networks` array in the same file.

**TypeChain** — A tool that generates TypeScript type definitions from your compiled contracts, enabling type-safe contract interactions.

**hardhat-deploy** — A Hardhat plugin that manages deterministic deployments and keeps track of deployed contract addresses across networks.

**Reown AppKit** — A wallet connection library (formerly WalletConnect AppKit) that provides a customizable modal for connecting Web3 wallets.
